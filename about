        I am a student athlete. I play baseball for my school. I currently play shortstop and I am excited for the upcoming spring season. I also like to play video gamed listen to music during my spare time. My favortie music artist I listen to is Rod Wave. I don't have a favorite genre of music I have a playlist for every genre depending on what I feel like listening to that hour. I like to be outdoors and hangout with my friends.
